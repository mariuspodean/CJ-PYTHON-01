Final Project Task: Create a text-based puzzle game.

The game will be about saving the world from a potential nuclear reactor explosion using only friendship.

We will have a class Player to define what goes on when someone is playing by storing their progression.

The player will be able to input their name and choose their own difficulty.

The difficulty is how many seconds you are allowed to play the game.

We will have a mutable mapping called LocationIterator.

We will have ascii art mixed in for aesthetic reasons and the overall adventure feel.

We will be using threading in order to run multiple things at once including a theme song.

We will have different files for each puzzle zone.

Through out the game the player will progress with his own actions by input.

We will have a scenario that sets up a game within a game in order to solve the riddle.

The riddle can be solved as soon as the player reaches the game withing a game stage.

The game is meant to have dead ends and take you in a loop until the time runs out and you lose.
However the game can be solved very fast as long as you realise what the key to win is.


We will have Player.py for the functionality of player1
We will have leave_or_stay.py for the application
We will have zones folder for the playground
We will have unittests.py for the tests
We will have theme_song.mp3 for the music played during gameplay
