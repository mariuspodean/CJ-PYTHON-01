Challenge
Implement a context manager called just_some_exceptions that will handle KeyError, IndexError by printing a message and let any other exceptions propagate outside of the context manager.

Implement the context manager by using both approaches: by using class and by using @contextmanager

Write examples that prove the functionality for all the handled exceptions and for one exception that is not handled.
