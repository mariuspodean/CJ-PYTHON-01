Build two classes of your choice that can model a real-life example. The class needs to meet the following requirements: 

* at least 5 attributes each


* at least 2 methods each


* one class to inherit from another 


As a demonstration create at least 5 instances of one class (preferably the child class) and call all the methods it holds

    Ex: You can have one class (`Country`) that has general attributes about countries such as `area`, `neighbours`, `cities` etc and methods related to those attributes. The second class can be a specific country (`Romania`) that has more specific attributes such as `attractions`, `universities` etc.
